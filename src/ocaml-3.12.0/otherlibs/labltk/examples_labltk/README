They are written in classic mode, except testris.ml which uses label

You may either compile them here, or just run them as scripts with
        labltk example.ml

hello.ml        A very simple example of CamlTk
hello.tcl       The same programme in Tcl/Tk

demo.ml         A demonstration using many widget classes

eyes.ml         A "bind" test

calc.ml         A little calculator

clock.ml        An analog clock  (uses unix.cma)

tetris.ml       You NEED a game also (uses -labels)
